* Alsa Rawmidi
In order to read/write rawmidi to/from alsa seq, we can use the raw
midi built into alsa:

sudo modprobe snd-rawmidi
sudo modprobe snd-virmidi

Now 4 new midi devices appear on the filesystem "/dev/snd/midiC3D0"
and these also appear in the alsa sequencer ports list so now you can
read/write raw midi and pipe it into the alsa sequencer...
